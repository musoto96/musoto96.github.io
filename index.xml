      <description>Recently, I acquired a computer on which I intend to run a virtualised firewall, for this purpose I installed pfSense this is an operating system based on FreeBSD with plenty of networking capabilities out of the box.
I also bought a 4G LTE modem card, a Huawei me909-120 along with a SIM card adapter and a wireless card to use as AP, but wi-fi is beyond the scope of this post.</description>

      <description>Many of us know awk only as a command line tool for quickly editing output from a previous command.
Few are aware that it is a fully fledged programming language. The fact that awk comes already installed on most Linux and Unix systems should be more than enough to highlight the importance of knowing its capabilities.
It is useful for a system administrator to be able to quickly put together an awk script that formats some input into a report, or to perform some math calculations from a file&amp;rsquo;s contents.</description>

      <description>About this site This website was created with the Hugo framework and the nostyleplease theme.
The images used as banners around the site, where created using AI, more specifically, Bing Image Creator powered by DALL-E.
The prompt was something like this example:
&amp;gt; An image with white backgound of an Aztec warrior with a skull face, using a laptop
I always had to do some cleaning up with Gimp but, for the most part, they came out pretty good straight from the Bing engine.</description>
