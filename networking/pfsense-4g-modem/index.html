    <h1>pfSense 4G Modem</h1>

    

    <p>Recently, I acquired a computer on which I intend to run a virtualised firewall, for this purpose I installed <a href="https://www.pfsense.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pfSense</a>
 this is an operating system based on <em>FreeBSD</em> with plenty of networking capabilities out of the box.</p>
<p>I also bought a 4G LTE modem card, a <strong>Huawei me909-120</strong> along with a SIM card adapter and a wireless card to use as AP, but wi-fi is beyond the scope of this post.</p>
<p>I noticed some strange behaviour on the 4G modem, and after not finding any solutions on <em>pfSense</em> forums, I decided to document the fix on a blog post.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In this article, we describe a problem found with a particular 4G modem card and we detail some steps to troubleshoot and fix it, even if you don&rsquo;t have this exact problem you can still benefit from the steps provided in the troubleshooting section.</p>

<h4 id="the-problem">The problem</h4>
<p>After configuring <em>Point to Point Protocol</em> (<strong>PPP</strong>)  interface and setting it as the <strong>WAN</strong> interface, the card disconnects and reconnects.
This can be seen on the <em>pfSense</em> dashboard, under <code>Status &gt; System Logs &gt; System</code></p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>ugen0.2: &lt;Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. HUAWEI Mobile V7R11&gt; at usbus0 (disconnected)
u3g0: at uhub0, port 6, addr 2 (disconnected)
u3g0: detached
ugen0.2: &lt;Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. HUAWEI Mobile V7R11&gt; at usbus0
u3g0 on uhub0
u3g0: &lt;Huawei Mobile Connect - Modem&gt; on usbus0
u3g0: Found 5 ports. 
</code></pre><p>As you can see on these kernel messages the card is disconnected from the port and then it is found again.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When this happens the serial port device is linked again with an increment of <strong>1</strong>.</p>
<p><em>e.g.</em> If originally the serial port was linked to <code>/dev/cuaU0</code> after seeing the previous messages it would now be at <code>/dev/cuaU1</code></p>
<p>This would result in the following <strong>PPP</strong> message message under <code>Status &gt; System Logs &gt; PPP</code></p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>[wan_link0] MODEM: can&#39;t ioctl(TIOCMGET) /dev/cuaU0.0: Device not configured 
</code></pre><p>Since the interface was configured to look for the modem&rsquo;s serial port under <code>/dev/cuaU0</code>, however, the card is now responding to serial commands under <code>/dev/cuaU1</code>. So one must now reconfigure the interface to use the new serial port.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Most of the time, this happened so fast the modem did not have a chance to even connect to the mobile network, making me think the card was flat out fried. But on a few attempts it managed to stay connected up to 5 or 6 minutes, even getting a public IP address, which gave me hope to look for a solution.</p>

<h4 id="reviewing-configuration">Reviewing configuration</h4>
<p>The configuration varies depending on the modem model and service provider. Probably the easiest way to know your <em>Access Point Name</em> (<strong>APN</strong>) is to plug the SIM card to your phone and connect to the network. The values should automatically fill in on your phone&rsquo;s mobile network settings and from there you can take note of the values you should use.</p>
<p>In this case for the <em>Huawei me909-120</em> card, I found in some forums I needed to have the following connection string</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>&amp;F&amp;C1&amp;D2E0S0=0
</code></pre><p>Under the PPP interface <em>Advanced configuration</em>. This string represents a few serial AT commands to get the card in a working state.</p>
<p>Aside from this there is nothing more to be done here, only configuring the interface according to <a href="https://docs.netgate.com/pfsense/en/latest/interfaces/ppp.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official docs on PPP</a>

You can do this with <code>dmesg</code> or with <code>usbconfig</code> you will need access to a shell for this.</li>

<ol start="2">
<li>Check the modem is responding to serial port</li>
</ol>
<p>Send a few <strong>AT</strong> commands to a serial port link, you may have to try different links until you find the one that works, here I send the command <strong>AT</strong> and the modem responded with <strong>OK</strong> then I send <strong>ATCSQ</strong> to check signal and this one returned an error.</p>
<p>You may not see your commands echoed back to your terminal, so try to type them and hit enter.</p>

But like this we can verify if the modem works and responds to serial commands.</p>
<p>On one particular port this was printed to my terminal, which is related to various signal metrics</p>

<h4 id="fixing-the-problem">Fixing the problem</h4>
<p>So far the card is correctly recognized and it is accepting AT serial commands, yet it is constantly reconnecting and thus changing serial device link on the <em>pfSense</em> appliance. Since <em>pfSense</em> does not automatically detect the serial device for a modem, we need a way to always set the same serial device for the modem.</p>
<p>Reading on a forum about a similar problem, people talked about device quirks, maybe this is a better approach for this problem, but the solution proposed here is to create a <strong><em>devd</em> configuration</strong>.</p>
<p>You can read from <code>man 8 devd</code>, <em>devd</em> is a system daemon that runs in the background and when a device is plugged in, it will perform actions according to <em>devd.conf</em>, you can see how this configuration works by reading <code>man 5 devd.conf</code>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>An example of its use is visible on some user friendly desktop Linux distributions; when you connect a USB storage device, <em>devd</em> will usually have a rule to automatically mount the filesystem somewhere on the system.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We will create a new rule file <code>/etc/devd/modem.rules</code> with this content:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>attach 0 {
    device-name &#34;u3g0&#34;;                           # Find this with: dmesg |grep -i &#34;card brand&#34;
    match &#34;vendor&#34; &#34;0x12d1&#34;;                      # Find this with: usbconfig dump_device_desc
    match &#34;product&#34; &#34;0x15c1&#34;;                     # Find this with: usbconfig dump_device_desc
    action &#34;/usr/local/bin/create_links.sh %d&#34;;   # A script we will create to map serial ports
};
</code></pre><p>You can find your device name with <code>dmesg</code> as shown before, or with <code>sysctl</code> if you know your card&rsquo;s brand name, or you can simply grep for <strong>usb</strong> and find your card there.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>root# sysctl -a | grep -i &#34;huawei&#34;
ugen0.2: &lt;Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. HUAWEI Mobile V7R11&gt; at usbus0
u3g0: &lt;Huawei Mobile Connect - Modem&gt; on usbus0
dev.u3g.0.%desc: Huawei Mobile Connect - Modem 
</code></pre><p> </p>
<p>The last line in the <em>modem.rules</em> file specifies the action, in this case, we will run a custom script to map the serial ports.
Create the script under <code>/usr/local/bin/create_links.sh</code> with this content:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e">#!/bin/sh
</span></span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"></span>device<span style="color:#f92672">=</span>$1
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>serial_ports<span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#66d9ef">$(</span>ls /dev/$device.*<span style="color:#66d9ef">)</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">for</span> port in $serial_ports; <span style="color:#66d9ef">do</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    link_name<span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#66d9ef">$(</span>echo $port | sed <span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;s/.*\.\(.*\)$/\1/&#39;</span><span style="color:#66d9ef">)</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    ln -sf $port /dev/cuaU0.$link_name
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">done</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>And grant the script execution rights</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>chmod u+x /usr/local/bin/create_links.sh
</code></pre><p><a href="#top">[Top]</a>
</p>
<h4 id="monitoring-uptime">Monitoring uptime</h4>
<p>At this point we can restart the <em>pfSense</em> appliance and verify that the serial device ports are no longer changing, they should always be linked to <code>/dev/cuaU0.*</code></p>
<p>After configuring <em>devd</em> rules it can be seen that the interface has no problems staying up.</p>

<p>In this post we covered a very specific problem on a 4G modem card. It is not clear if the issue has to do with compatibility, hardware or software, maybe it is related to the modem card&rsquo;s firmware.</p>
<p>In any case, since the card was properly detected and receiving serial commands it prompted me to search for a simple solution instead of just buying a new card, I must say I did use the help of <a href="chat.openai.com/">ChatGPT-3.5</a>
 in my troubleshooting and for the creation of the linking script.</p>
